## Features

🛠 Built with [React][reactjs], [XState][xstate], [Express][express], [lowdb][lowdb], [Material-UI][material-ui] and [TypeScript][typescript]  
⚡️ Zero database dependencies  
🚀 Full-stack [Express][express]/[React][reactjs] application with real-world features and tests  
👮‍♂️ Local Authentication  
🔥 Database Seeding with End-to-end Tests  
💻 CI/CD + [Cypress Dashboard][cypressdashboard]

## Getting Started

The Cypress Real-World App (RWA) is a full-stack Express/React application backed by a local JSON database ([lowdb]).

The app is bundled with [example data](./data/database.json) (`data/database.json`) that contains everything you need to start using the app and run tests out-of-the-box.

> 🚩 **Note**
>
> You can login to the app with any of the [example app users](./data/database.json#L2). The default password for all users is `s3cret`.  
> Example users can be seen by running `yarn list:dev:users`.

### Prerequisites

The only requirement for this project is to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) **version 14** installed on your machine. Refer to the [.node-version](./.node-version) file for the exact version.

TypeScript will be added as a local dependency to the project, so no need to install it.

### Installation

```shell
yarn install
```

#### Mac M1 chip users will need to prepend `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true`.

```shell
PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true yarn install
```

### Run the app

```shell
yarn dev
```

> 🚩 **Note**
>
> The app will run on port `3000` (frontend) and `3001` (API backend) by default. Please make sure there are no other applications or services running on both ports.
> If you want to change the default ports, you can do so by modifying `PORT` and `REACT_APP_BACKEND_PORT` variables in `.env` file.
> However, make sure the modified port numbers in `.env` are not commited into Git since the CI environments still expect the application to run on the default ports.

### Start Cypress

```shell
yarn cypress:open
```

> 🚩 **Note**
>
> If you have changed the default ports, then you need to update Cypress configuration file (`cypress.json`) locally.
> There are three properties that you need to update in `cypress.json`: `baseUrl`, `apiUrl`, and `url`.
> The port number in `baseUrl` corresponds to `PORT` variable in `.env` file. Similarly, the port number in `apiUrl` and `url` correspond to `REACT_APP_BACKEND_PORT`.
> For example, if you have changed `PORT` to `13000` and `REACT_APP_BACKEND_PORT` to `13001` in `.env` file, then your `cypress.json` should look similar to the following snippet:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "baseUrl": "http://localhost:13000",
>   /* Omitted for brevity */
>   "env": {
>     "apiUrl": "http://localhost:13001",
>     /* Omitted for brevity */
>     "codeCoverage": {
>       "url": "http://localhost:13001/__coverage__"
>     }
>   },
> }
> ```
>
> Avoid committing the modified `cypress.json` into Git since the CI environments still expect the application to be run on default ports.

## Tests

| Type | Location                                 |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| api  | [cypress/tests/api](./cypress/tests/api) |
| ui   | [cypress/tests/ui](./cypress/tests/ui)   |
| unit | [`src/__tests__`](./src/__tests__)       |

## Database

- The local JSON database is located in [data/database.json](./data/database.json) and is managed with [lowdb].

- The database is [reseeded](./data/database-seed.json) each time the application is started (via `yarn dev`). Database seeding is done in between each [Cypress End-to-End test](./cypress/tests).

- Updates via the React frontend are sent to the [Express][express] server and handled by a set of [database utilities](backend/database.ts)

- Generate a new database using `yarn db:seed`.

- An [empty database seed](./data/empty-seed.json) is provided along with a script (`yarn start:empty`) to view the application without data.

## Code Coverage Report

The Cypress Real-World App uses the [@cypress/code-coverage](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage) plugin to generate code coverage reports for the app frontend and backend.

To generate a code coverage report:

1. Run `yarn cypress:run --env coverage=true` and wait for the test run to complete.
2. Once the test run is complete, you can view the report at `coverage/index.html`.

## 3rd Party Authentication Providers

Support for 3rd party authentication is available in the application to demonstrate the concept and commands needed for programmatic login.

### Auth0

A [guide has been written with detail around adapting the RWA](http://on.cypress.io/auth0) to use [Auth0][auth0] and to explain the programmatic command used for Cypress tests.

Prerequisites include an Auth0 account and a Tenant configured for use with a SPA. Environment variables from Auth0 are to be placed in the [.env](./.env).

Start the application with `yarn dev:auth0` and run Cypress with `yarn cypress:open`.

The only passing spec on this branch will be the [auth0 spec](./cypress/tests/ui-auth-providers/auth0.spec.ts); all others will fail.

### Okta

A [guide has been written with detail around adapting the RWA](http://on.cypress.io/okta) to use [Okta][okta] and to explain the programmatic command used for Cypress tests.

Prerequisites include an [Okta][okta] account and [application configured for use with a SPA][oktacreateapp]. Environment variables from [Okta][okta] are to be placed in the [.env](./.env).

Start the application with `yarn dev:okta` and run Cypress with `yarn cypress:open`.

The **only passing spec on this branch** will be the [okta spec](./cypress/tests/ui-auth-providers/okta.spec.ts); all others will fail.

### Amazon Cognito

A [guide has been written with detail around adapting the RWA](http://on.cypress.io/amazon-cognito) to use [Amazon Cognito][cognito] as the authentication solution and to explain the programmatic command used for Cypress tests.

Prerequisites include an [Amazon Cognito][cognito] account. Environment variables from [Amazon Cognito][cognito] are provided by the [AWS Amplify CLI][awsamplify].

Start the application with `yarn dev:cognito` and run Cypress with `yarn cypress:open`.

The **only passing spec on this branch** will be the [cognito spec](./cypress/tests/ui-auth-providers/cognito.spec.ts); all others will fail.

### Google

A [guide has been written with detail around adapting the RWA](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/testing-strategies/google-authentication.html) to use [Google][google] as the authentication solution and to explain the programmatic command used for Cypress tests.

Prerequisites include an [Google][google] account. Environment variables from [Google][google] are to be placed in the [.env](./.env).

Start the application with `yarn dev:google` and run Cypress with `yarn cypress:open`.

The **only passing spec** when run with `yarn dev:google` will be the [google spec](./cypress/tests/ui-auth-providers/google.spec.ts); all others will fail.
